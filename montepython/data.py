        The Data class holds the cosmological information, the parameters from
        the MCMC run, the information coming from the likelihoods. It is a wide
        collections of information, with in particular two main dictionaries:
        cosmo_arguments and mcmc_parameters.

        It defines several useful **methods**. The following ones are called
        just once, at initialization:

        * :func:`fill_mcmc_parameters`
        * :func:`read_file`
        * :func:`read_version`
        * :func:`group_parameters_in_blocks`

        On the other hand, these two following functions are called every step.

        * :func:`check_for_slow_step`
        * :func:`update_cosmo_arguments`

        Finally, the convenient method :func:`get_mcmc_parameters` will be
        called in many places, to return the proper list of desired parameters.

        It has a number of different **attributes**, and the more important
        ones are listed here:

        * :attr:`boundary_loglike`
        * :attr:`cosmo_arguments`
        * :attr:`mcmc_parameters`
        * :attr:`need_cosmo_update`
        * :attr:`log_flag`

        .. note::

            The `experiments` attribute is extracted from the parameter file,
            and contains the list of likelihoods to use

        .. note::

            The path argument will be used in case it is a first run, and hence
            a new folder is created. If starting from an existing folder, this
            dictionary will be compared with the one extracted from the
            log.param, and will use the latter while warning the user.

        .. warning::

            New in version 2.0.0, you can now specify an oversampling of the
            nuisance parameters, to hasten the execution of a run with
            likelihoods that have many of them. You should specify a new field
            in the parameter file, `data.over_sampling = [1, ...]`, that
            contains a 1 on the first element, and then the over sampling of
            the desired likelihoods. This array must have the same size as the
            number of blocks (1 for the cosmo + 1 for each likelihood with
            varying nuisance parameters). You need to call the code with the
            flag `-j jast` for it to be used.

        To create an instance of this class, one must feed the following
        parameters and keyword arguments:

            folder, etc...  Most of the information extracted from the
            command_file will be transformed into :class:`Data` attributes,
            whenever it felt meaningful to do so.
        path : dict

            find the cosmological module location.

        This class replaces the old function defined in the Data class, called
        `from_input_to_mcmc_parameters`. The traduction is now done inside the
        Parameter class, which interprets the array given as an input inside
        the parameter file, and returns a dictionary having all relevant fields
        initialized.

        .. warning::

            This used to be an ordered dictionary, for no evident reason. It is
            now reverted back to an ordinary dictionary. If this broke
            anything, it will be reverted back

        At the end of this initialization, every field but one is filled for
        the specified parameter, be it fixed or varying. The missing field is
        the 'last_accepted' one, that will be filled in the module :mod:`mcmc`.

        .. note::

            The syntax of the parameter files is defined here - if one
            wants to change it, one should report the changes in there.

        The other fields are

        Attributes
        ----------
        initial : array
            Initial array of input values defined in the parameter file.
            Contains (in this order) `mean`, `minimum`, `maximum`, `1-sigma`.
            If the min/max values (**TO CHECK** proposal density boundaries)
            are unimportant/unconstrained, use `None` or `-1` (without a period
            !)
        scale : float
            5th entry of the initial array in the parameter file, defines the
            factor with which to multiply the values defined in `initial` to
            give the real value.
        role : str
            6th entry of the initial array, can be `cosmo`, `nuisance` or
            `derived`. A `derived` parameter will not be considered as varying,
            but will be instead recovered from the cosmological code for each
            point in the parameter space.
        prior : :class:`Prior <prior.Prior>`
            defined through the optional 7th entry of the initial array, can be
            ommited or set to `flat` (same), or set to `gaussian`. An instance
            of the :class:`prior` defined in :mod:`prior` will be initialized
            and set to this value.
        tex_name : str
            A tentative tex version of the name, provided by the function
            :func:`io_mp.get_tex_name`.
        status : str
            Depending on the `1-sigma` value in the initial array, it will be
            set to `fixed` or `varying` (resp. zero and non-zero)
        current : float
            Stores the value at the current point in parameter space (`not
            allowed initially`)

        Parameters
        ----------
        value : list
            Array read from the parameter file
        key : str
            Name of the parameter
